Complexity describes how much space or time an [[Algorithm]] uses. 

Time complexity describes how many operations are performanced, which will generally lead to longer execution times.

Space complexity describes how much memory is used during execution.

The complexity is oftern described in [[Big O notation]], [[Little o notation|little o notation]] and  Omega notation, and in terms of N where N is the given input for an algorithm.

(1) describes [[Constant time and space]]
(logN) describes a [[Logarithmic time and space]]
O((logN)<sup>k</sup>) where k is a constant describes polylogarithmic time and space
(N) describes [[Linear time and space]] 
(N<sup>2</sup>) describes quadratic time and space
(N<sup>k</sup>) where k is a constant describes [[Polynomial time and space]]
(k<sup>N</sup>) where k is a constant descrbies Exponential time and space
(N!) describes factorial time and space
