A cycle in a [[Graphs|graph]], is a path that never ends because at a given vertex, it is visited again later in the path.

for example in [[#Graph 4]] there is a cycle of 1 -> 2 -> 3, because at the end of 3, it then can loop around to 1 and start again. 

In an undirected graph we do not normally consider a cycle across one edge
