Like in c# an [[Arrays|array]] can be created using the following syntax in [[Java]]
```java
int[] array = new int[3];
```

To initialize an array with values you can use the following syntax
```java
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3 }
```
When initializing an array here we do not need to specify the length, because its implied through the constructor

Simular to C# this will be allocated on the [[Heap (Memory)|heap]].
