A linked list is a way of storing and representing a collection of data. Instead of being stored in consecutive spaces in memory, each element in a linked list points to the next node. A pointer to null indicates the end of the linked list.

The head of the linked list is the root, the first node that points to the second node and so on.

## Iteration
To iterate over a linked list you start with the head, and follow its next pointer. You repeat this along the linked list until you find a pointer to null.

## Doubly Linked Lists
In a doubly linked list the list holds a pointer to the previous node as well as the next node. This allows you to iterate backwards.

## Tree / Graph
The linked list is a [[Trees|tree]] with a limit of one child per a node or vertex. Of course all trees are [[Graphs|graphs]] which means that tree and graph alogrithms are often appliable to linked lists.
