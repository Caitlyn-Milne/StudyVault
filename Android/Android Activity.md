In android an activity is a single focused thing on a user device. Almost all activities require input from the User, and therefore the activity class takes care of creating a window. Activities are often presented as full screen windows, but they could be other things windows, such as bubbles, or embedded windows.

An activity is the apps entry point, where the main activity is launched when opening an app, other activities might be opened by your, or other apps. An example of this is an email app might show a list of emails in its main activity, but when tapping on an email notification, it might directly open an activity displaying that email.

Activities are generally supposed to be modular, and be decoupled from other activities in an app.
