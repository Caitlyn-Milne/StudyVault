NP Complete problems are problems that can not be easily solved (with in [[Polynomial time and space]]) through an [[Algorithm|algorithm]] , however NP problems can be checked if they are correct easily.

NP-Complete is a subset with in [[NP]] where the problems are the hardest in NP. A problem is harder than another problem is solving the first problem solves the second.

Because they are the hardest problems within [[NP]], if NP Complete is equal to [[P]] then  [[Does P = NP|P = NP]]
